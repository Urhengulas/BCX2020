## about
The **Zero Emission Factory** was the winning project of the **zero emission track** at the [Bosch Connected Experience Hackathon 2020](https://bosch-connected-world.com/hackathon/).

### problem
Factories all over the world produce goods and use A LOT of energy every day and thereby are responsible for a big share of the energy consumption and CO$_2$-production of a country. 

### solution
This project explores the possiblity to optimize the production times for the availability of green energy.
